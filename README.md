# webpack-react-redux-starter

This is a simple React Redux Starter boilerplate. You can use it to start
working directly on your app code that matters, saving a lot of setup time.

This comes with Webpack 2 as module bundler, Babel to compile ES6 to vanilla
javascript and Bootstrap css and js.


## Getting started

```
git clone https://github.com/anuragaryan/webpack-react-redux-starter.git MyApp
cd MyApp
npm install
```

It comes with developement and production mode.

For Developement use: `npm run dev`
For Production use: `npm run prod`
